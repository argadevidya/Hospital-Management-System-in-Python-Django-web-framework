##  Installation :

Here are the general steps to install the Hospital-Management-System-in-Python-Django-web-framework:

1.  Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.  Install Django: Open your terminal/command prompt and type the following command to install Django:

      pip install django

3.  Download the project: You can download the project from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ChaitanyaKaranam/Hospital-Management-System-in-Python-Django-web-framework

4.  Extract the project: Extract the downloaded zip file into a suitable location on your system.

5.  Create a virtual environment: It is recommended to create a virtual environment for this project. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

python -m venv env

This will create a virtual environment named env.

6.  Activate the virtual environment: Once the virtual environment is created, activate it using the following command:

    source env/bin/activate
7.  Install project dependencies: With the virtual environment activated, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the project dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

8.  Migrate the database: Run the following command to create the database tables:

    python manage.py migrate
    
9.  Create a superuser: Run the following command to create a superuser (an administrator account for the system):

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    
    
10.  Run the server: Finally, start the Django development server by running the following command:

    python manage.py runserver
    
    The server will start running on the localhost, and you can access the Hospital Management System by visiting http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser. You can log in to the system using the superuser account created in step 9.
